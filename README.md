Just Another F\*ckin' Last.FM DashBoard

## Info

This is just a playground for some css and javascript stuff.
Why not combine it with an obsession for music, last.fm and statistics?

All clientside (for now), maybe some serverside stuff later if I can find the strength to do so.

## Usage

Copy local (or on your webserver when you want to be funky) and pass your last.fm username like this:
index.html?username=onslower
